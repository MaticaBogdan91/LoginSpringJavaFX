# Login Spring JavaFX

In this project I used Java , Spring , and as front-end I used Java Fx
The project is directly connectet wit data base MySQL 

Main purpose of this project is that you can Register your self using , usern-ame, full-name , email , and password

It is made to Login as ADMIN role  or USER role

It is made if you try to login with Admin dates to show you some specific dates for admin, same for trying to login with User daates , will receive another dates specific for user not the same as Admin

If you login as USER you will be able to get just messages witch a User it schould be allowed to se , same with ADMIN will be able to see specific messages as admin

If you try to login with wrong informations you will receive a message Error as : Username and / or password not valid 

It's made to show you when you run it first java Fx page with login 

You can register on register page  and all your informations will be saved automaticly in data base MySQL and after with this dates you cand login with the new registred user 
When you clik on the register buton you will be Automaticly redirected to the registration page 

I made some password validations , if the password is to short , to long , or contains bad words , will recieve message with error because you must respect all of the
validation 

# Main purpose on this project is to make it better and replace JavaFX with Angular
