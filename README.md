# Login Application Spring JavaFX

In this project, I used Java, Spring, and as front-end, I used Java Fx
The project is directly connected with database MySQL 

The main purpose of this project is that you can register using, username, full name, email, and password.

It's made to log in as ADMIN role  or USER role.

It is made if you try to login with ADMIN dates to show you some specific dates for ADMIN, same for trying to login with User dates, will receive another date specifically for the user not the same as ADMIN.

If you log in as USER you will be able to get just messages witch a USER it should be allowed to see, same with ADMIN will be able to see specific messages as admin.

If you try to log in with wrong information you will receive a message error as Username and/or password not valid. 

It's made to show you when you run it first java Fx page with login. 

You can REGISTER on the registration page  and all your information will be saved automatically in database MySQL after this date, you can login with the newly registered user. 
When you click on the register button you will be automatically redirected to the registration page. 

I made some password validations, if the password is too short, too long, or contains bad words, will receive a message with an error because you must respect all of the
validation. 

# the Main purpose of this project is to make it better and replace JavaFX with Angular
